## About <a name = "about"></a>

This small project was part of a Go study session. It was originally part of the  Go tutorial by [Net Ninja](https://netninja.dev/) on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gC88BEo9czgyS72A3doDeM).

It was my first contact with Go and I deeply enjoyed the learning process.
